//! Callback interfaces of asynchronous message for [`Connection`] and [`Channel`].
//!
//! In AMQP_0-9-1 protocol, some messages (`methods` in AMQP's term) can be initiated by server.
//! These messages are handled asynchronously by client via callbacks.
//!
//! User should define its own callback types and implement the traits [`ConnectionCallback`]
//! and [`ChannelCallback`].
//!
//! After open a connection, immediately register the callbacks by [`Connection::register_callback`].
//! After open a channel,  immediately register the callbacks by [`Channel::register_callback`].
//!
//! # Examples
//! See [`DefaultConnectionCallback`] and [`DefaultChannelCallback`] for simple example.
//!
//! The default callback implementations are only for demo and debugging purposes.
//! User is expected to implement its own callbacks.
//!
//! [`Connection`]: ../connection/struct.Connection.html
//! [`Connection::register_callback`]: ../connection/struct.Connection.html#method.register_callback
//! [`Channel`]: ../channel/struct.Channel.html
//! [`Channel::register_callback`]: ../channel/struct.Channel.html#method.register_callback
